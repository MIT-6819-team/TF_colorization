## The Places 2 dataset

In the training set, we've noticed that there are some very unsaturated and grayscale images included in the training dataset. Using a script, we removed 38,613 of the 1,434,892 training images that had less than 1% average saturation. These unsaturated images formed about 2.7% of our original dataset.
